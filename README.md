### /Splits
* Timer Starts when first entering combat in a raid zone
* Timer Pauses when all bosses in a raid are killed
* "/Splits" opens the option menu
* __Max Prev Splits__ controls the amount of previous kills to display below the timer. Most recent boss is always at the top. Set to 0 to hide all
* __Show Time Saved__ controls whether to print the time saved, displayed as (+00:00) in red if behind and (-00:00) in green if ahead, if available
* __Show Record Time__ will display the fastest completed run, if available
* __Hide/Disable Timer__ will disable the timer until turned back on. Current timer will be reset and splits will not be tracked
* New record times and splits are only saved on completed runs when a new best time is achieved, even if individual splits are faster
* Doing bosses in a different order is okay but time saved will compare to the fastest run so may not reflect whats actually going on. and is only updated if a new fastest time is achieved
